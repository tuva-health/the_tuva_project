Steps for transforming eligibility data into member demographics:
    1) Determine enrollment status using eligibility from the collection year.
    2) Roll up to latest eligibility record for enrollment statuses.
    3) Add age groups based on the payment year.
    4) Determine other statuses.

Jinja is used to set payment year variable.
 - The payment_year var has been set here so it gets compiled.
 - CMS guidance: Age is calculated as of Feb 1 of the payment year.
 - The collection year is one year prior to the payment year.
